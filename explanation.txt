I wasn't sure what we should submit for MA5, since so far we have only written a simple smart contract that we can only run using a test network and since we dont have any test data. Thus, I wasnâ€™t sure how exactly should we do this assignment since I don't understand what the test data will be in our case and how we would implement a target in run.py since our file will be .sol (solidity) which we can only run on the test network with a test Ethereum account that has test Ethereum for the gas fees. Thus since testing needs to be done in a test network (for our case we use goerli) so the files needed for this submission are empty and I included the smart contract in the file run.sol.
