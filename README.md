# DSC180A-Methodology-5

The TA said to submit empty files for MA5 **(later the professor said I don't have to submit at all in this 
edstem post - https://edstem.org/us/courses/28947/discussion/2202683)**
since so far we have only written a simple smart contract and since our industry mentor just provided a 
template for our Q1 project which is the solidity file (run.sol) which we can only run using a online
test network and since we dont have any test data (our project doesn't rely on stored data in any way). 
Thus, I wasnâ€™t sure how exactly we should do this assignment since I don't understand what the test data
will be in our case and how we would implement a target in run.py since our file will be .sol (solidity)
which we can only run on the online test network with a test Ethereum account that has test Ethereum for 
the gas fees. Thus since testing in our case cannot be done locally and needs to be done in a online test  
network (for our case we use goerli), the TA said to submit the files needed for this submission as empty 
and include the smart contract which is the file run.sol (professor provided and we deployed in our section).

The following is a link to the deployed smart contract (run.sol) where we perform testing.
